# SPA-location
This is my location SPA

link to page: https://unequal-mom.surge.sh/

In this SPA I used Vanilla JS for the client side, Node.js and express on the server side.

I used Babel to transpile the code into a static website and hosted it with surge.

The main goal with the SPA was to learn how to make one and how to display the users GPS coordinates.

Enjoy!
